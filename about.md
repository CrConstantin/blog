Hello!

This is my childish intro :ghost:

My name is Cro, I'm 33, I live in Romania.

I'm a software developer since 2007. I make nice programs :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
Check [my Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/croqaz){:target="_blank"} and be amazed.

This is my blog/ experiment.

I will only post articles that I find interesting.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/croqaz/croqaz.github.io/issues) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/croqaz){:target="_blank"}.

Thanks!
