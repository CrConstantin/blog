Hello!

This is my childish intro:

My name is Cro, I'm 33, I live in Romania.

I'm a software developer since 2007. I make nice programs :)

This is my blog/ experiment.

I will only post articles that I find interesting.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/croqaz/croqaz.github.io/issues) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/croqaz).

Thanks!
