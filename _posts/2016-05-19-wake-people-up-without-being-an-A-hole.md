It’s fair to say that all of us don’t know what we’re talking about when it comes to specific topics. We might have excellent awareness in some areas, but next to none in others. Yet whenever we read the comments section of anything controversial on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WakingTimes) or elsewhere, there are always the various opposing views, many of which are ignorant, condemning and outright abusive. The disheartening aspect is many people who have awoken to some of the conspiratorial ‘truths’ that have been brilliantly exposed by the independent media, as well as run a relatively good heart program, can still be some of **the most ignorant bullies out there**.

From a personal standpoint, we should all be able to recognise that we’re learning everyday. Sometimes we might even have strong convictions about particular beliefs, but if we’re adamant about conducting holistic and robust research, we’ll inevitably find that we have gotten something strikingly wrong.

If unbiased and deep investigation has been a process that we have engaged in for many years, it would no doubt be a less common occurrence. Still though, it’s clear that we need to stay open to not just evolving our views, but entirely transforming that which we ‘believe’ we ‘know’. Otherwise, we’ll inescapably fall subject to falsity, [dogma](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2016/05/04/spirituality-versus-dogmatic-religiosity-guide-spiritually-perplexed/) and bigotry.

In this light, it’s important to engage people with opposing or varied views through not just healthy debate, but conversation too. **If we head into a discussion with the attitude that we’re only out to ‘win’, then what are the consequences if we’re wrong?** Will we be shut off from developing our own perspective and therefore behave in ways that resemble the mainstream mentality?

Of course we would be.

The community of awakening individuals is on the right track, but let’s be real about it; most people who are only just beginning to stir from their slumber have very little idea of what they’re talking about. This is obviously even more applicable to the sleeping masses as well.

When we first begin to wake up to the greater realities of our existence, we only have a very limited perspective on the entire spectrum of concepts and knowledge that constitute the truth and sovereignty movements. And even though there are many people who have been engaged in this process for decades, even they will still have it wrong in some ways.

**This awakening spectrum can be thought of as two distinct categories; on one side is opening to the spirituality of reality, and on the other lies the lies of the economic and social structures.** Some of us are waking up in both areas, whilst others only explore one of the two.

For example, many people who understand the propaganda and mechanisms of [the control-matrix](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2016/05/17/eyes-control-matrix/) reject anything of a spiritual nature. This is unfortunate because there is so much to be learned from exploring the consciousness of reality and its deep interconnection on an ecological, quantum physical and symbolic level.

It adds magic to the madness, which speaks volumes of good vibrations to the heart and mind.

The same goes for those who have tapped into some of the bigger philosophical realities. Many have completely lost their sense of direction when it comes to navigating their way through the monetary, medicinal, political, educational and other social structures which have been hijacked by the corporatocracy that has long established the core control of how human affairs are organised on a global scale.

Unfortunately, some prefer to keep their head in the sand and just ‘secretly’ hope that everything will work out okay without them needing to activate their inner activist and contribute to the many growing grass-roots movements which have sprung up all over our world.

This is not only imbalanced, but hypocritical too.

Of course there are many deceptions which are either purposely or mistakenly created within both areas, too. For example, [the new age movement](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2016/02/13/10-basic-new-age-deceptions-and-how-to-correct-them/) is plagued with false ideology that steers people off track. In all fairness though, there are many essential ‘truths’ woven within it, so** it’s an amateur mistake to throw the baby out with the bath water once we see through the haze.**

This also applies to the orchestrated infiltration of our social systems. One example is that there are differences in opinion for _who the men behind the curtain actually are_, as well as what is the ‘right’ way to move forward in terms of an economic and social model. Regardless of the truth about these issues – which really is impossible to definitively ascertain – its important that we all unite under the simple agreement that [the money supply](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2015/10/30/why-do-we-allow-private-banks-families-to-control-the-worlds-money/) and the [matrix-media](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2015/12/05/6-positive-signs-that-mainstream-media-is-collapsing/) are the two primary control mechanisms**that we need to educate people on and address first.

We also need to be active in building self-sustaining systems on a local and community level too, which unfortunately very few people have stepped up to actualize.

Another example is the infighting over the US presidential race, as well as whether the political system can be used to our advantage or not. One thing that is indisputable among all this noise is that this circus has been beneficial to the cause because many people are becoming more conscious through the commentary provided by Trump and Sanders. This stands, even if the political duopoly has always been an effective divide and conquer strategy employed by the powers-that-will-no-longer-be.

Let’s not get too lost in the details about the candidates either; let’s just accept that Hillary is a puppet of the establishment and that it’s a good thing that Trump and Sanders have had the opportunity to tell their stories.

It is in this sense that the political arena has been conclusively shown to be an effective vehicle to wake up the sleepwalking masses. In this light, one day it might even be able to be used to solidify the real change we need for real freedom and justice. We’re obviously not there yet, but we very well might be if we capitalised on the power we have as a collective.

Of course we are all [anarchists](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2015/05/18/5-reasons-why-anarchy-would-an-improvement-in-human-governance/) at heart; we all covertly or overtly desire the freedom from being ruled (which for those who don’t know is the true definition of anarchy). **Excessive government and dictatorships are not and never will be the answer to anything positive and productive.** Yet the logic of using politics as a mechanism at the very least to educate the masses, as well as one day re-instituting our natural and sovereign rights, is crystal clear.

Plus, the nuclear and other weaponry that exists these days needs to be kept in check; without some sort of management system the psychopathy of unmonitored collectives of people will inevitably kill us all. Simply, there has always been tyrannical structures and monopolies which have manifested all throughout human history, so once again we need a platform to ensure that we undermine the powers-at-be-now, as well as guarantee it doesn’t happen into the future.

In summary, **the struggle for freedom is an ancient journey** so we shouldn’t overlook the fact that the political framework has actually brought some positive results. We should capitalise on it to continue this agenda, instead of completely condemning it just because it’s not working perfectly in this moment. If we recognize that a balanced approach is always the right approach, then we can recognize the value in working within the system to achieve our goals, as well as building on the outside too.

In any case, that’s my personal view, and hey, I accept that I might be wrong. And even if I am, that doesn’t mean that I deserve to be abused over it. I used this example because regardless if we’re talking about as something as complex as this issue, or something more mundane, we definitely need to take a more respectful approach towards each other. 

Unfortunately, this is not a common reality online. If we look at any forum which discusses politics, [the failed war-on-drugs](http://www.wakingtimes.com/2016/01/05/the-problem-is-drug-law-not-drugs/), conspiratorial information or many other divisive topics, then we’ll see a plethora of ignorance and abuse that really is an embarrassment to the fight for truth and freedom.

For example, even if we are aggressively approached by a highly indoctrinated mindset that is still in the fantasy land of the mainstream mentality, then meeting abuse with abuse gets no-one anywhere fast. If we’re direct and real, but still show a bit of compassion for their delusion, then we might actually be able to help them understand the illusory predicament they’re in. 

This also goes for those who have a lot of intellectual capacity, but still have their head in the sand about the way the world really is; if we can subtly help them to understand that the brainwashed-expert quota has already been filled, then everybody wins.

And of course the same goes for those we meet who are on the same team of truth and freedom; it might be us or it might be them who needs to evolve our view, so **if we’re each open to the developmental path, then we’re all likely to learn and grow from the experience.**

Simply, **we don’t need to be an asshole about it.** We all had to begin the waking up experience at one stage so its hypocritical if we are. Plus, it just doesn’t work anyway, so let’s put our pride to the side and engage our fellow truth-seekers (even if they don’t know it yet) in a way that’s going to maximise their chance of emancipating themselves from their psychological prison.

Ultimately, bullying and abusive behaviour is a disgrace to those who consider themselves as ‘waking up’. We should always be real, direct and assertive – that should never change – but we should also take a serious chill pill and be sympathetic to the ignorance of others, as well as our own.

After all, nobody has all the answers.
