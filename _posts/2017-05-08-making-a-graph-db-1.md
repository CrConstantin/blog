So what's this all about? This is my first article *(hopefully out of many)*, where I'll describe my journey of learning how to build a **[Graph Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database)**.

Node: I'm not sure how far I'll go yet, I'm doing this in my spare time, so I make no promises...

My background is: software programmer for about 10 years now. I've written many kinds of software and used several databases: MySql, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, MongoDb, RethinkDB, LevelDB; but I'm no expert, just your regular user.
I've also used IPFS and Ethereum, not the regular kind of databases, but fun to learn nonetheless.

And this is how I want to do it: I'll imagine that what I'm trying to do is already finished, then I'll explain to you how I did it :D
This mental hack keeps me focused and confident, even though it's a HUGE task...

Q: So why am I doing this?
A: Because it's fun. Because it's a huge challenge, way more than I can handle. Because I need this kind of library. Because I'll use this knowledge, even if it doesn't become a stable product.

Q: What's my use-case?
A: I want to save all the countries in the world and all their relations; all the animals and plants in the world and all the data I can find about them; all my favorite movies, with all the actors and the most relevant relations between them; quantity conversion (length, weight, temperature). *Maybe in the future, I'll implement a nice GUI to visualize and edit the nodes and edges*.

Q: What's the maximum data size?
A: I'm thinking 10 million edges. It's a pretty big number for a toy database (see [Visualizing 1 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000) and multiply x 10). And if this becomes serious, I'll target more.

Q: Will this be open-source?
A: Yes. Most of it, anyway.

Q: What programming languages will I use?
A: Any, or all of: Elixir, Python, Node. In this exact order. I prefer Elixir the most, because it's really fun to play with and I want to learn it better. But I might end up using Python, because I'm the most productive with it. Node is also a great option, because there are hundreds of thousands of libs to help me.

The tasks:

- study Neo4J, Titan, Riak
- study MongoDB, RethingDB, CouchDB
- stody LevelDB, RocksDB, Redis
- study what exactly is a graph, the math, the theory
- study how to store a graph on a computer

The first things that I found:

- [Youtube.com/watch?v=82zlRaRUsaY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82zlRaRUsaY) (from Complexity Labs)
- [Youtube.com/watch?v=HmQR8Xy9DeM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmQR8Xy9DeM) (from PatrickJMT)

Until the next time!

If I have some audience, I'll be more focused on details and I'll write more often, obviously.
