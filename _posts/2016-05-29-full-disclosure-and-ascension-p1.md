Although things seem "almost too quiet" in the open world at the moment, the war in the Secret Space Program world has never been hotter or more intense...

![](/public/images/Chevron-battle-final.jpg)

We are no longer getting full intel due to operational security -- but we have strong clues as to what this is leading to.

The art at the top of this article is a professional rendition of the aerial part of the battle that is happening now, based on high-level intel.

This is not at all a normal situation. Due to "masking" technology this war is mostly invisible to us, but there are traces of the battle that we can measure.

The teardrop-shaped craft are of the Draco, and the triangular "chevron" craft are a new and unexpected surprise attack from what appears to be the Alliance.

We will provide the full context in this article to help you understand what is going on now, and where it may be leading.

In order to set up the story, it is necessary to frame the expansive new view that is required through some little-known but conventional examples.

[Note: The article will undergo updates that will be added in red after it is first posted, over the next 24 hours. We will notate them here as it unfolds.]

### **PART ONE: CARGO CULTS AND THE SECRET SPACE PROGRAM**

**A RADICAL CHANGE CAN QUICKLY BECOME THE BORING "NEW NORMAL"**

Take a look at the device you are reading these words on right now. It's a part of your everyday routine to use it. You don't even think that much about it.

The gadget generally works the way it is supposed to. Although you don't know everything, you learned how to use it and can function with it.

You can read articles, play videos with impressive production effects, talk to people who you can see on the screen, and order goods and services delivered.

With just a few clicks, you can guarantee that in as little as 24 hours, someone will arrive at your doorstep with a box containing whatever you want.

You don't have to do any work to make those items. Nor do you have to go anywhere to find them. They just manifest as if by magic.

### **EVERYTHING SEEMS ORDINARY**

Now take a look at your surroundings. If you are indoors, notice things like glass windows, carpeted floors, electric appliances and the clothing you wear.

You probably have a wallet containing plastic cards that can get you the things you want just by swiping them through a machine with buttons.

Look at the materials your surroundings are made of, the functions they perform and the comforts they afford you. All very normal.

Yet if you projected someone from even a few hundred years ago into your situation, they would be dazzled by the mysterious things they saw.

If they were then returned to their own vicinity, they would soon tell tales of meeting mystical "gods" in a heavenly realm with inexplicable magic and wizardry.

### **EVERYTHING YOU EXPERIENCE BECOMES "NORMAL"**

You can also jump on a plane and travel vast distances that would have taken months, either by horse or by boat, before the [railroad was invented in 1804.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rail_transport)

You can now travel fast enough that the time your body expected to be day becomes night -- and vice versa.

![](/public/images/First-Railroad-Passenger-Car.jpg)

![](/public/images/first_railroad.jpg)

Any interior location is ultimately just some form of a room. There you are in a room, sitting down, maybe looking out the window, and it's all very typical.

If you are in a car, train or plane, you are still inside a familiar craft.

The seats, the windows, the decor and what you see outside the craft is all completely non-challenging to your belief systems. Everybody knows this stuff.

### **LOTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO MEET**

You see people of all different races in the course of your daily routine -- both in person and in other forms. Asians, Latinos, Caucasians, people of African descent and others.

You are not in the least bit surprised or unsettled by the differences in how they look. It's all very normal to you.

It's only when something or someone new comes along that, for a brief time, your entire reality can turn upside down.

Soon, however, even a radical new change -- like discovering a new and different race of people -- becomes a normal, everyday part of life.

### **CARGO CULTS**

Thayer Watkins, a faculty member at San Jose State University, is [one of many scholars to have covered the intriguing phenomenon of "cargo cults" that formed in some of the South Pacific islands.](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/cargocult.htm)

Most of these islands were in an area called Melanesia, to the northeast of Australia. This area was right near Japan in the theater of battle during World War II.

Several different Melanesian islands that had lived in almost complete isolation were suddenly contacted by mysterious-looking people with white skin during the war.

Military troops flew in with advanced technology, concerned that these islands could be infiltrated by the enemy and used as bases to mount new attacks.

Australia and New Zealand were Allied countries and there were fears that Japan would try to invade them by air or by sea from the northeast.

These islands were also used as staging areas to fight active and bloody battles, such as in Guadalcanal, which is within the Solomon Islands in the map below.

Hence, Melanesia suddenly became an area of key tactical significance in WWII, providing a very dynamic example of "enculturation" in 20th century history.

![](/public/images/Melanesian_Cultural_Area1.png)

The natives were exposed to a level of sophistication, civilization and technology unlike anything they could possibly have expected before then.

This is of far greater significance to our current situation than almost anyone realizes.

The people of Melanesia were unaware of the greater world around them.

As far as they were concerned, Melanesia was the world, and everyone there was to know lived there.

The idea that their population was very small, and there were far greater places to live than where they were, never even occurred to them.

Nor could they imagine technology beyond the primitive level they had attained on their own.

### **PROF. THAYER WATKINS ON THE 'CARGO CULTS'**

Here is the excerpt from our San Jose State University professor that helps us get this discussion started.

This is an issue of key importance to the insider world that I have heard about for years. After following up on this research lead, I now understand why.

We have added images to strengthen the point. Take a look:

Prof. Thayer Watkins on "Cargo Cults"

[http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/cargocult.htm](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/cargocult.htm)

After World War II, anthropologists discovered that an unusual religion had developed among the islanders of the South Pacific.

It was oriented around the concept of _cargo_, which the islanders perceived as the source of the wealth and power of the Europeans and Americans.

This religion, known as the Cargo Cult, held that if the proper ceremonies were performed, shipments of riches would be sent from some heavenly place.

It was all very logical to the islanders.

![](/public/images/cargo-cult.jpg)

![](/public/images/cargocult_plane_fire.jpg)

The islanders saw that they worked hard but were poor, whereas the Europeans and Americans did not work but instead wrote things down on paper. 

In due time, a shipment of wonderful things would arrive.

The Cargo Cult members built replicas of airports and airplanes out of twigs and branches. 

They made the sounds associated with airplanes to try to activate the shipment of cargo.

![](/public/images/cargo-big.jpg)

![](/public/images/Cargo-Cult_behind_plane.jpg)

Although the existence of the Cargo Cult only became known after World War II, the cult had developed long before, when the Europeans first arrived in the area in ships.

There were legends among the islanders of their distant ancestor-god having journeyed to the west, and promising to someday return....

![](/public/images/cargo_cults_11.jpg)

Islanders would build a hut in the forest, and the cultees would bring money and leave it in the hut in expectation that it would grow.

Sometimes replicas of briefcases would be used to hold the money.

Unfortunately the money would often be stolen from these jungle banks, leaving the islanders even poorer than they were before....

![](/public/images/cargo_cults_17.jpg)

![](/public/images/xMH_CargoCults_.jpg)

![](/public/images/cargo_005.jpg)

![](/public/images/john-frum-day-03.jpg)

In New Guinea, the Australian authorities enlisted the aid of the son of a famous warrior to discourage the Cargo Cult.

He was effective, and as a reward the Australians gave him a trip to Sydney.

While in Sydney, this man visited an anthropological museum. There he saw the sacred cult objects of his people on display.

When the man returned to New Guinea, he spread the word that **the source of the Australians' power was that they had stolen the sacred art of his people -- and built a temple to house it.**

A new cult developed around this idea.

### **THE PROMISES OF THE "GODS" WERE NOT KEPT**

The WWII soldiers who visited and assisted these islands also shared their own Christian teachings, including the idea of end times and Ascension.

The war ended. The enemy of U.S.A. never tried to invade the islands or use them as a staging area.

The tactical significance of the islands disappeared. The promises of the "gods" were not kept. No one went back to give them more Cargo.

The "Cargo cults" formed after these cultures were left alone. The results were wildly unanticipated.

Even the most mundane aspects of our "modern" civilization were elevated into elaborate, arcane religious ceremonies, held in extremely high importance.

![](/public/images/cargo_cult_gun.jpg)

![](/public/images/cargo-cult2.jpg)

![](/public/images/cargocult_plane_prayer.jpg)

### **AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CIVILIZATION COULD BE OPERATING ON EARTH WITHOUT OUR AWARENESS**

Although this knowledge is publicly available, it carries far greater significance within the insider military-industrial complex community than in the world at large.

You and I could be living on "islands" right here on Earth that we call continents -- thinking these are the only places where anyone can live. 

Despite how advanced we think we are, we may have no idea of the true scope of people and technology that is operating around us.

These people may have visited us and given us "Cargo" in what we would think of as the distant past. We soon formed elaborate belief systems around it.

The original "Cargo" may have long since disappeared, but various relics and artwork remain -- paying homage to what our ancestors once saw.

Other "Cargo" may have crashed in far more recently -- and inspired many of the breakthroughs we now take for granted in our society.

We now think we have all the answers. We fervently believe we understand reality, and that our conclusions are sensible, even obvious.

We fight and defend our belief systems, even to the death, since they are "normal." It is what "God" has revealed to us -- such as the god of Science.

We feel whatever level of technology we have right now is the best there is, or will be.

We can barely imagine having anything better at this point.

Each new change is gradual enough that we are only somewhat excited before it, too, becomes "normal."

### **SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN DISCUSSED THE CARGO CULT RELIGION IN MAY 1959**

Like the cargo cults, we have only had brief glimpses of "unidentified flying objects" and "aliens" in the everyday world.

Not everyone believes the multitudinous eyewitness accounts. Those who do are only further emboldened by their opposition.

Like the cargo cults, the knowledge we gain from our visitors can quickly get contorted into belief systems that are rarely, if ever questioned:

May 1959 Scientific American Article on "Cargo Cult" Religions

[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/1959-cargo-cults-melanesia/](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/1959-cargo-cults-melanesia/)

The people of the central highlands of New Guinea are only the latest to be gripped in the recurrent religious frenzy of the "cargo cults."

However variously embellished with details from native myth and Christian belief, **these cults all advance the same central theme: the world is about to end in a terrible cataclysm.**

Thereafter God, the ancestors or some local culture hero will appear and inaugurate a blissful paradise on earth.

Death, old age, illness and evil will be unknown. The riches of the white man will accrue to the Melanesians.

Although the news of such a movement in one area has doubtless often inspired similar movements in other areas, the evidence indicates that **these cults have arisen independently in many places** as parallel responses to the same enormous social stress and strain.

Among the movements best known to students of Melanesia are the "Taro Cult" of New Guinea, the "Vailala Madness" of Papua, the "Naked Cult" of Espiritu Santo, the "John Frum Movement" of the New Hebrides and the "Tuka Cult" of the Fiji Islands.

**At times the cults have been so well organized and fanatically persistent that they have brought the work of government to a standstill.**

The outbreaks have often taken the authorities completely by surprise and have confronted them with mass opposition of an alarming kind....

Troops on both sides in World War II found their arrival in Melanesia heralded as a sign of the Apocalypse.

The G.I.s who landed in the New Hebrides, moving up for the bloody fighting on Guadalcanal, found the natives furiously at work.

**[The natives were] preparing airfields, roads and docks for the magic ships and planes that they believed were coming from "Rusefel" (Roosevelt), the friendly king of America.**

### **LET'S THINK IF THERE ARE ANY PARALLELS**

If you don't think the "cargo cults" have any similarity to what is going now, these images may cause you to think again:

![](/public/images/M5007.jpg)

**DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY**

Please don't take this the wrong way. This information is not intended to belittle you or your beliefs.

It is simply being offered to provide you with a highly relevant example of truth. Every era that thought they "knew it all" has been horribly wrong.

In our own case, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas are the "islands" where this much larger cargo cult has formed.

Hardly any of us have ever visited the Antarctic or bases inside the earth.

We do know these places exist, but access is very tightly regulated.

Our own "cargo cult" has certain religious beliefs about these places that are never questioned. Therefore, we believe hardly anyone lives in these areas.

Everything we think we know is 'normal' to us, and therefore considered to be an everyday fact of life.

### **WE ARE THE ISLANDS WITH OUR OWN "CARGO CULTS"**

We now have extensive, undeniable evidence that our solar system and our own Earth is already colonized on a vast scale by people we are not normally familiar with.

This includes remarkably cross-correlating insider testimony as well as photographic evidence of anomalous structures on the Moon, Mars and other moons.

These structures include pyramids, obelisks, a gigantic human face, enormous glass-like domes and collapsed rooftops of squared-off underground rooms.

Much of this evidence has been summarized and presented in _The Ascension Mysteries,_ which I just finished writing and is due out August 30th.

Never before have I put together a "grand summary" of all the best insider data like this. I am very enthusiastic about the effect it will have on you as you read it.

[Thanks to your support, this book hit #1 in four different Amazon categories, and made it up to #64 out of all books in their entire catalog.](http://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/1198-panama-ascension)

Pre-ordering the book locks in a lower price and ensures you will receive "cargo" on or around August 30th!

### **SOME PEOPLE ON OUR ISLANDS DO KNOW ABOUT "THE REST OF THE WORLD"**

There are also people from our own 'islands' who are already deeply involved in this greater civilization. 

They have hidden that connection from the rest of us.

New insider testimony has revealed that the Cabal -- the global elite bankers -- were pursuing a Secret Space Program (SSP) ever since the late 1700s, at least.

### **THE FIRST SSP MOVES WERE TO MAKE DIRIGIBLES**

The Cabal's first move was to set up secret bases in South America in the early 1800s. 

There, they attempted to achieve space travel through secret balloon / dirigible technology.

The work began on a larger scale by 1825, and significant success was achieved by 1850.

[In the open, declassified world, the first steam-powered airship appeared in 1852\. It traveled for 17 miles at 6 miles per hour.](http://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/g1281/a-brief-history-of-the-airship/?slide=2)

![](/public/images/bho-airship1.jpg)

As always, the classified tech was much better than anything the world was seeing.

Count Ferdinand Von Zeppelin patented a rigid airship design in 1895 that led to dirigibles becoming destructive weapons in World War I.

Von Zeppelin's patent was another example of a classified technology leaking out into the open so it could eventually be used for tactical purposes.

![](/public/images/bho-airship2.jpg)

Ultimately dirigibles were discontinued after [events like the Hindenberg in 1937,](http://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/g1281/a-brief-history-of-the-airship/?slide=5) and the realization that strong wind currents could slam them to earth and kill everyone.

Classified German dirigibles from World War I were so huge that they served as flying aircraft carriers, capable of transporting multiple warplanes at once.

![](/public/images/blimp-size.jpg)

![](/public/images/Schutte-Lanz_silhouettes.jpg)

### **CLASSIFIED AIRSHIPS MADE A BIG SHOWING IN 1895-96**

In the classified world, things were moving along much better in the 1800s.

This peaked in a wave of "airship" sightings where German-speaking people piloted their craft along the Transcontinental Railroad in America.

The railroad was built and owned by Harriman, a Cabal member. The craft landed and German-speaking individuals spoke to locals and even gave them rides.

Since this was a classified program intended to colonize our solar system, these events have never been officially acknowledged even to this day.

Real antigravity and the ability to leave Earth orbit did not arrive until the Germans cut deals with certain ET groups in the early 20th century.

This data has been provided by insiders including "Bruce," Hoagland's top insider featured in the new book, as well as aerospace engineer William Tompkins.

### **WARS ARE ONGOING TO KEEP US FROM KNOWING THE TRUTH**

Wars have been fought for millennia to keep our 'islands' from knowing about the vastly larger populations that surround us, and the technology they have.

Like the Melanesians just prior to World War II, we think the island continents we now live on are the full extent of the civilized life out there in the universe.

Now, instead of seas that are too difficult to travel across long distances, we have the vastness of space.

Just as the Melanesians did not have boats that could circumnavigate the globe, we do not openly have any tech that allows us to travel into space.

Therefore, wars could be going in our solar system, and around our earth with the use of cloaking technology, that we are completely unaware of.

These wars appear in our terms to be very ancient.

The written reports of them have since turned into religions, filled with beliefs and ceremonial re-enactments.

The Melanesians had no idea how huge our world really was. All they saw were a few soldiers and their tech. Entire belief systems were created around this.

As we head into Part Two, we will discuss the massive amount of human life in our galaxy, and the differences in time perception that can and do occur.

### **NORMAL TIME FOR US MAY BE VERY SLOW FOR OTHERS**

Now that we have reviewed cargo cults and the idea that a classified mission to colonize space was well underway in the 1800s, it is important to widen our focus.

The next concept of 'normal' that needs to be shattered is our idea of time, and the speed with which it passes.

We now have scientific proof that there are lifeforms on earth who experience time far more slowly than we do.

This was discovered by a group of scientists from Ireland and Scotland, and published in 2013:

11/16/13: Time Passes More Slowly For Flies, Study Finds

[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/16/time-passes-slowly-flies-study](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/16/time-passes-slowly-flies-study)

Flies avoid being swatted in just the same way Keanu Reeves dodges flying bullets in the movie The Matrix – by watching time pass slowly.

To the insect, that rolled-up newspaper moving at lightning speed might as well be inching through thick treacle.

Like Reeves standing back and side-stepping slo-mo bullets, the fly has ample time to escape....

The evidence comes from research into the ability of animals to detect separate flashes of fast-flickering light.

"Critical flicker fusion frequency" – the point at which the flashes seem to merge together, so that a light source appears constant – provides an indication of time perception....

"A lot of researchers have looked at this in different animals by measuring their perception of flickering light," said Dr Andrew Jackson, from Trinity College Dublin in the Republic of Ireland.

"Some can perceive quite a fast flicker and others much slower, so that a flickering light looks like a blur.

"Interestingly, there's a large difference between big and small species. **Animals smaller than us see the world in slo-mo. It seems to be almost a fact of life**.

"Our focus was on vertebrates, but **if you look at flies, they can perceive light flickering up to four times faster than we can**.

"You can imagine a fly literally seeing everything in slow motion."

### **INSIDERS ARE WELL AWARE OF THE "FLICKER FREQUENCY"**

This "flicker frequency" effect has been widely known to insiders for some time.

Our insider Pete Peterson conducted elaborate research in "black ops" projects on the variances among individuals in their actual perception of flickering light.

Certain people can detect a light flickering at a much faster frequency than others.

Those people are not susceptible to propaganda and mind control techniques. They also have an average of 10 to 15 points higher IQ scores.

About 18 percent of the population has this characteristic, and it is distributed across all races.

It does appear that this is directly correlated with the amount of extraterrestrial human DNA that any given person has within them.

This "vibrational increase" can also be taught. It is not strictly genetic in nature. The "ageless wisdom" of all great spiritual teachings tells us how to do this.

### **THE FLICKER FREQUENCY GENERATOR**

Pete also invented a "flicker frequency generator" that was used by all high-level American politicians to help them avoid various mind control strategies.

It was a small matchbox-sized device worn under a suit lapel. You would hold the light up to your eye and turn the dial until the flickering appeared solid.

Then you would wear the device and it would use a form of micro-gravitational currents to stimulate your mind to remain at a higher flicker frequency.

There are various technologies, such as extremely low-frequency or ELF waves, that can negatively affect people's moods -- as one example.

These devices effectively counteracted those influences. All politicians of the 60s and 70s were secretly wearing these devices according to Peterson.

### **HUMAN ETs ARE ANOTHER GREAT SECRET**

The arrival and interbreeding of extraterrestrial humans on earth -- people who look similar to us or just like us -- is another great insider secret.

I have encountered this information from a wide variety of independent insiders, and correlated it with ample provable evidence in the everyday world.

In _The Ascension Mysteries,_ we fully trace the 500,000-year history of the human immigrants to Earth who became what we now know as the Cabal.

These people arrived as giants with elongated skulls. The best time estimate of their final crash-landing to Earth is 55,000 years ago, as we discuss in the book.

They were many tens of IQ points ahead of everyone else. They portrayed themselves as "gods" and established rulership all over the world.

![](/public/images/meritaten_side.jpg)

_Bust of Egyptian Pharaoh Akenhaten / Nefertiti's Daughter Meritaten -- Side View_

They created huge civilizations with advanced tech, only to have them repeatedly beaten back into the Stone Age by cataclysms authorized by positive ETs.

Over thousands of years, some of them dropped to normal human heights while retaining the elongated skulls.

This included the Egyptian dynasties, Peru, Boskop South Africa, and Siberia, as discussed in the book.

![](/public/images/PPP.jpeg)

![](/public/images/elongated_skull_side.png)

Others remained as giants, while still having the elongated skulls.

Certain of these scattered, worldwide groups managed to survive, and retained a full record of who they were and where they had originated from.

The documents are still held now in the Vatican. Peterson personally held the books and saw diagrams of huge space stations and ships inside them.

Despite the fascination and detail of this story, this is still only one of a wide variety of groups who are living and working in our solar system at this time.

The Cabal group we call "the Empire" in the book has kept its existence hidden from the rest of us, since they are afraid of being singled out as invaders.

### **THE ELITE ARE BEING EXPOSED**

Furthermore, they consider themselves to be the "elite," the descendants of gods, and the rest of us to be inferior beings -- even "useless eaters." 

Some high-level members still have the elongated skulls and remain in hiding. They are not "reptilian shapeshifters," as some legends have surmised.

As strange as this may sound, this is the main group controlling Western governments, the financial system and media, and it espouses Luciferian beliefs.

The dam is starting to break on this story.

Earlier this week, the main page of Huffington Post carried a testimonial from Elijah Wood of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, exposing darkness in Hollywood.

![](/public/images/huff_elijah.jpg)

5/23: Elijah Wood Says Hollywood Has a Pedophilia Crisis On Its Hands

[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elijah-wood-says-hollywood-has-child-abuse-crisis_us_5742f86ee4b0613b512aaeba](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elijah-wood-says-hollywood-has-child-abuse-crisis_us_5742f86ee4b0613b512aaeba)

While he was fortunate enough to have his mother protect him when he went to Hollywood as a kid, Wood admitted, “I’ve been led down dark paths to realize that these things probably are still happening.” 

He also said there are “a lot of vipers in this industry” and that Hollywood has “darkness in the underbelly.” 

“If you’re innocent, you have very little knowledge of the world and you want to succeed,” he said, “﻿People with parasitic interests will see you as their prey. What upsets me about these situations is that the victims can’t speak as loudly as the people in power.”

Wood may be the highest-level celebrity yet to come forward about what he knows -- and [it hit the front page of Huffington Post just this week.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elijah-wood-says-hollywood-has-child-abuse-crisis_us_5742f86ee4b0613b512aaeba)

[A follow-up article on Thursday, May 26th shared the equally damning testimony of Corey Feldman.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/corey-feldman-child-abuse-hollywood_us_5746ec0de4b03ede4413e74c) Things are really picking up on this story.

The Cabal cannot silence people indefinitely. The dam is breaking.

### **GAME OF THRONES IS A CABAL DOCUMENTARY, THINLY DISGUISED AS FICTION**

Insiders also told me that "Game of Thrones" was intended to reveal "Illuminati" secrets about British history, thinly disguised as fiction.

I heard this a few years ago, binge-watched 3-4 seasons before being turned off by violence against children, and now finally people are figuring it out.

[Earlier this week, Digg.com -- an aggregator of the most popular "viral" content online -- linked to a video that makes the case very effectively.](http://digg.com/video/westeros-game-thrones-great-britain)

Though this guy talks a little too fast for my taste, he nonetheless shares a variety of irrefutable points of evidence linking Game of Thrones with British history:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pj9fn4L4Njk" width="560"></iframe>

### **THE RABBIT HOLE GOES VERY, VERY DEEP**

"Game of Thrones" is only one of countless examples of movies and TV shows that expose the Cabal / Illuminati agenda.

The surprising reality is that the deeper you go into studying this, the more propaganda you find.

I was particularly stunned to watch "Zoolander 2," in which the bloodline of Cain story, a key Cabal myth, was thoroughly presented in the film.

In this religion, Lucifer the serpent was actually an extraterrestrial human who impregnated Eve in the garden.

Abel was Adam's child, and Cain was Lucifer's child.

The only difference in the film is that "Cain" is changed to "Steve," making it more silly-sounding.

[We exposed all of this occult religious teaching in October 2014 at this link, well before the movie ever came out.](http://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/1170-cabal-defeat?showall=&start=1)

Were they copying us? Very unlikely.

Owen Wilson's character spends the first 15-20 minutes of the movie wearing an eagle-like golden wing over his right eye -- a clear Cabal symbol.

This does not mean Wilson is "one of them." One high-level insider told me "Comedy actors always want to work, and are encouraged to take all offers."

It does appear that many actors have little or no understanding of what is really going on. That way they are never a threat if they decided to talk.

### **JUSTIN BIEBER IS SHOT TO DEATH PROTECTING THE BLOODLINE OF CAIN**

Justin Bieber is shot to death at the beginning of the movie, and is one of many celebrities who died protecting the secrets of the bloodline.

![](/public/images/Zoolander-2-Trailer.jpg)

### **THE ENTIRE THIRD ACT IS A CHILD SACRIFICE**

Movies are written in three-act structures. Act 1 is traditionally pages 1-30 in a screenplay. Act II is 30 through 90\. Act III is 90 through 120, and the movie ends. 

These three acts are considered to be Setup, Conflict and Resolution. It's also akin to the idea of Beginning, Middle and Ending.

The entire third act of Zoolander 2 features a child sacrifice of Zoolander's hidden son, who carries the occult bloodline of "Steve."

In an astonishing "outing", a majority of the leading fashion icons in the world appear in their genuine forms as cameos in the third act.

"Zoolander 2's" deep bench of designer cameos includes Marc Jacobs, [Tommy Hilfiger](http://www.latimes.com/topic/business/consumer-goods-industries/clothing-textiles-industry/tommy-hilfiger-PEBSL000104-topic.html "Tommy Hilfiger"), Alexander Wang and Valentino (we won't spoil a plot point but rest assured it goes way beyond the step-and-repeat sound bites of the first film).

**Valentino**, **Tommy Hilfiger**, **Alexander Wang** and **Marc Jacobs** are among the top designers to pop up in Stiller’s catwalk comedy, alongside a handful of models: **Kate Moss**, **Naomi Campbell**, **Jourdan Dunn** and **Karlie Kloss**.

There’s even a turn from American Vogue editor **Anna Wintour** – and, inevitably, **Kim Kardashian**.

### **THE FASHION ICONS ARE ALL PARTICIPATING IN A CABAL-TYPE RITUAL**

These real-world fashion designers are all wearing hooded cloaks and have gathered in a stony dungeon to participate in the child sacrifice.

No matter how clueless you may be about the existence of this group, I dare you to watch this scene and not get creeped the f-k out.

Here is how it was described on the Kids in Mind site, documenting scenes in films that are potentially damaging for children to watch:

Zoolander 2 Child Sacrifice Scene -- Kids in Mind

[http://www.kids-in-mind.com/z/zoolander2.htm](http://www.kids-in-mind.com/z/zoolander2.htm)

Cloaked and hooded fashion designers enter an old dark stone church and gather around a brightly lit central area. 

[In this setting,] another man in gaudy clothing stands and opens a circular area on the floor. A pre-teen boy [then] rises, tied on a cross-like table.

The man shouts and rants about the fashion industry, takes a wide knife and attempts to stab the boy in the heart. 

[This occurs] while men and women wearing cloaks chant, "The blood of Steve!" over a dozen times.

The man shouts that he wants the blood of the fat little chosen one.

### **THIS PROBLEM IS NOT AS OBSCURE AS YOU MIGHT THINK**

"Well, that's just a movie," the skeptic or paid disinformant might say. "They are just making fun of Illuminati conspiracy theories."

Here is a direct bibliographical reference pulled from the new book, and an extended excerpt of what it revealed about the scope of this problem:

Holden, Michael. “UK Police Say 261 ‘People Of Public Prominence’ Suspected Of Child Sex Abuse.” Reuters, May 20, 2015.

[http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-abuse-idUSL5N0YB3PH20150520](http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-abuse-idUSL5N0YB3PH20150520)

LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - British police investigating allegations of historical child sex abuse said **more than 1,400 people had been named as suspects including 261 described as "people of public prominence," including dozens of politicians and TV stars.**

Child abuse scandals over the last few years have prompted the government to launch a major public inquiry and for detectives to establish an over-arching investigation into allegations of historical crimes by those in powerful positions.

Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the officer leading that inquiry named "Operation Hydrant," said 1,433 people were being investigated of whom 216 were now dead.

**The suspects included 135 figures from TV, film or radio, 76 politicians involved in both local and national politics, 43 from the music industry and seven from the sporting world.**

"This investigation is massive and a testimony to how the attitude to victims is changing," said Sheila Taylor, chief executive of the National Working Group Network, a charity which tackles child sexual exploitation.

The issue of child abuse came to widespread prominence in 2012 when the late BBC TV presenter Jimmy Savile was shown to have abused hundreds of victims for decades.

Since then, other household names have been convicted, allegations have been made against a number of former or deceased politicians, while detectives are also looking into claims powerful figures forced police to drop inquiries into pedophile rings involving high-profile people.

Bailey said that **666 of the offenders being investigated were alleged to have carried out abuse at institutions including schools, children's homes, and religious institutions.**

### **HMM... NOW WHY WOULD THEY SAY 666 OFFENDERS ABUSED IN SCHOOLS AND RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS?**

The number 666 appears to have been deliberately included in this Reuters article as a clue "for those with eyes to see" that this is a Luciferian cult problem.

The sheer number of public figures involved -- 135 media figures, 76 politicians, 43 music industry figures and seven sports personalities -- should be considered.

How many more would there really be in an era of only four major television stations? These numbers suggest it is the majority, not a minority.

If you want to read the full, ugly truth of the problem, check out the UK Daily Express article [Jimmy Savile Was Part of Satanic Ring.](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/370439/Jimmy-Savile-was-part-of-satanic-ring)

You will read eyewitness testimony of someone being raped in a children's hospital by Savile and others in black robes as part of a satanic ritual.

### **THIS NEGATIVE INFLUENCE HAS AFFECTED ALL OF US**

_The Ascension Mysteries_ discusses this problem thoroughly, including how this negative influence in our society affects us in our everyday lives. 

It also reveals the full, cosmic scope of how these people got here, and the various ET groups that are at work in the grand drama we are now living in.

We are the new equivalent of Melanesia, [(see Part One,)](http://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/1200-full-disclosure-asc) and the world is much bigger and has far more people living on it than what we see on the "islands."

### **THE BATTLE FOR FULL DISCLOSURE**

Major wars are now taking place that are bringing the battle for Full Disclosure to the forefront of our times.

Hillary Clinton is using the promise of disclosure to try to attract more voters into her embattled Presidential campaign, as one example. 

[The New York Times covered this story in detail as of May 10th.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-aliens.html)

![](/public/images/hillary_xfiles.jpg)

Furthermore, military maneuvers occurred this past week in Tampa, Florida, suggesting possible training exercises for major events in our near future.

We have heard intel for years now that there will be arrests of many high-level Cabal people at some critical moment, involving combined military maneuvers.

Special Ops Troops Assault Downtown Tampa to Thunderous Applause

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/05/26/special-operations-troops-assaulted-downtown-tampa-all-to-thunderous-applause/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/05/26/special-operations-troops-assaulted-downtown-tampa-all-to-thunderous-applause/)

TAMPA — On Wednesday, Special Operations troops from more than a dozen countries jumped out of helicopters, rappelled from buildings and expended hundreds of rounds of ammunition as they attempted to rescue the mayor of this Florida city.

The operation was, of course, an exercise, but it was also a public spectacle for a force that has tried desperately to remain in the shadows despite now being at the forefront of America’s wars.

_[[U.S. Special Operations units are using faulty rifle sights](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/04/03/u-s-special-operations-units-are-using-faulty-rifle-sights/)]_

Aside from U.S. Special Operations forces, including Navy SEALs, Marine Raiders and Army Green Berets, countries such as Ireland and Jordan also participated in the exercise. Many of the participants covered their faces, and only a select few were allowed to speak to the media afterward.

“A lot of what we do is a bit secretive, we don’t really advertise much of what we do and there is a reason for it,” U.S. Special Forces Lt. Col. Chris Robeshaw told reporters following the event. “I think … this is maybe a stark reminder that there are young men and women out there putting themselves at risk.”

### **ANONYMOUS HACKER COLLECTIVE GOING AFTER CABAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS**

In several articles on this site, we detailed how at least a part of Anonymous is a secret division of the US military working against the Cabal.

This is one of the groups in what we are now calling the Earth Alliance.

Another sign of the war heating up is that Anonymous has made several very powerful hack attacks against Cabal banks recently:

![](/public/images/anonymous_hacks_blackout.jpg)

5/26: "Anonymous" Hits Top Cabal Financial Institutions, Controlled Media Completely Ignores

[http://www.activistpost.com/2016/05/anonymous-hits-new-york-stock-exchange-world-bank-the-fed-vatican-total-media-blackout.html](http://www.activistpost.com/2016/05/anonymous-hits-new-york-stock-exchange-world-bank-the-fed-vatican-total-media-blackout.html)

Amidst a global media blackout of Anonymous’ ongoing worldwide attacks on the “corrupt banking cartels,” the hacking collective has now taken down some of the most prestigious institutions in global governance.

**OpIcarus has recently taken offline the World Bank, the New York Stock Exchange, five U.S. Federal Reserve Banks and the Vatican.**

After announcing a [global call to arms](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/anonymous-fires-opening-massive-assault-global-banking-cartel/) against the “corrupt global banking cartel,” the hacker collective, known as Anonymous, in conjunction with Ghost Squad Hackers, have taken over 30 central banks offline, including striking many targets at the heart of the Western imperialist empire.

An Anonymous press release explained the intention behind the operation:

> The banks have been getting away with murder, fraud, conspiracy, war profiteering, money laundering for terrorists and drug cartels, have put millions of people out on the street without food or shelter and have successfully bought all our governments to help keep us silenced.
>
> We represent the voice of the voiceless. We are uniting to make a stand.
>
> The central banks which were attacked in recent days were attacked to remind people that the biggest threat we face to an open and free society is the banks. The bankers are the problem and #OpIcarus is the solution.

Operation Icarus was relaunched in conjunction with a video release announcing the beginning of a “30-day campaign against central bank sites across the world.”

Since that time, the scope and magnitude of the attacks have increased exponentially, with Anonymous, Ghost Squad Hackers, a number of Sec groups and BannedOffline coordinating attacks — each focusing on separate financial institutions in an effort to maximize the number of targets hit.

In a previous [interview with the Free Thought Project](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/anonymous-takes-u-s-federal-reserve-bank-england-offline-massive-cyber-attack-20-central-banks-hit/), an Anonymous representative clarified that the operation is in no way intended to impact individuals’ accounts held within the banks, explaining that OpIcarus is directed solely at the 1% perpetuating injustice:

> We would just like to make it very clear that all targets of #OpIcarus have been Rothschild and BIS central owned banks.
>
> In fact most of the targets so far such as Guernsey, Cyprus, Panama, Jordan, British Virgin Isles, etc are in the top 10 places of tax havens for the elite.
>
> No on-line consumer accounts were harmed, no ATM’s were blocked and no personal client data was leaked. This has been a protest against the Central Banks and the 1% — no innocent or poor people were harmed.

**THE LAW OF ONE SERIES HAS VERY SIMILAR DATES AS THE SSP FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE "EMPIRE" TO EARTH**

Lt. Col. Gonzales, our high-level insider from the Secret Space Program (SSP) Alliance, revealed the Cabal's ancestors crash-landed here 55,000 years ago.

I didn't have time to get this one into the book, but it is very interesting that the SSP date of 55,000 years ago is very close to what we see in the Law of One series.

The Law of One series has correlated with a huge amount of insider information remarkably well, including the 500,000-year history we spoke of.

In Law of One terms, the key date where trouble started on earth that necessitated a catastrophe was 53,000 years ago.

The exact nature of the trouble was never mentioned at the time, but in hindsight it becomes obvious from the new intel what was being discussed here.

In _The Ascension Mysteries,_ I establish that Ra is actually a positive group whose teachings were horribly contorted into the negative after they left Earth:

[21](http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=21).[25](http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=21#25) **Questioner:** Just to quickly refresh my mind— how many years ago did Lemuria suffer its catastrophe?

**Ra:** ...This was approximately fifty thousand [50,000] of your years ago.

The origins being approximately five three, fifty-three thousand [53,000] of your years ago.

The damage being completed in that last small cycle of the first master cycle.

[21](http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=21).[26](http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=21#26) **Questioner:** Did you mean to say master or major cycle?

**Ra:** ...The appropriate sound vibration complex is major cycle.

[21](http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=21).[27](http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=21#27) **Questioner:** Thank you. Then did the ending of this first major cycle have something to do with the destruction of Lemuria, or did this destruction just happen to occur at the end of that cycle?

**Ra:** ...**There is a confluence of energies at the ending of a major cycle.**

This encouraged what was already an **inevitable adjustment in the movement of the surfaces of your planetary sphere.**

[21](http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=21).[24](http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=21#24) **Questioner:** As we progress into the second 25,000-year cycle, did— At this time, during this period, was this the period of Lemuria?

**Ra:** ...This is incorrect.

However, those who escaped the destruction of Lemuria by natural catastrophe and were thus of Lemurian background continued their learn/teachings at locations [worldwide.]

[These were] ranging from your South America onward through the Americas as you know them and continuing over what was at that time a bridge which no longer exists.

There were those in what you would call Russia… [tape ends]

### **THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENCES JUST WITHIN OUR OWN BIOTA**

Now let's get back to the science of time perception, as it is of far greater significance in the understanding of certain human ETs than we may realize.

Our Irish and Scottish researchers found large discrepancies in time perception between species on earth, and equated it with their size in this case:

11/16/13: Time Passes More Slowly For Flies, Study Finds

[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/16/time-passes-slowly-flies-study](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/16/time-passes-slowly-flies-study)

The animals studied covered more than 30 species, including rodents, eels, lizards, chickens, pigeons, dogs, cats and leatherback turtles.

The latter are big creatures with a slow metabolic rate, for whom time passes relatively rapidly.

Smaller, more agile creatures had the most refined ability to perceive information in a unit of time, said the researchers writing in the journal Animal Behaviour.

In other words, they were able to see more flickers of light per second.

### **SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN COVERED THE SAME STUDY IN 2014**

This groundbreaking study was further explored in a Scientific American article from July 1st, 2014.

7/1/14: Small Animals Live in a Slow-Motion World

[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/small-animals-live-in-a-slow-motion-world](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/small-animals-live-in-a-slow-motion-world)

Evidence suggests that distinct species do indeed experience passing time on different scales....

Time perception depends on how rapidly an animal's nervous system processes sensory information.

To test this ability, researchers show animals a rapidly flashing light. If the light flashes quickly enough, animals (and humans) perceive it as a solid, unblinking light.

The animal's behavior or its brain activity, as measured by electrodes, reveals the highest frequency at which each species perceives the light as flashing.

Animals that can detect the blinking at higher frequencies are perceiving time at a finer resolution.

In other words, movements and events will appear to unfold more slowly to them—think slow-motion bullet dodging in an action movie.

The scientists who ran the new study gathered data from previous experiments on the rate at which visual information is processed in 34 vertebrates, including lizards, birds, fish and mammals....

**Dogs can take in visual information at least 25 percent faster than humans** - just enough to make a television show look like a series of flickering images.

### **A CHART OF DIFFERENT TIME PERCEPTION SPEEDS**

It is interesting to reflect on the idea that dogs are not going to enjoy TV as much as we do, because it doesn't look "real" to them.

The frame refresh rate isn't fast enough. We are easily fooled even by the 24 frames per second of a film or 30 of video, but they would not be.

The Scientific American article also presented the following graphic, showing the "flicker frequency" of time perception between various species.

This is measured in hertz, or cycles per second:

![](/public/images/SAmind0714.jpg)

The sea turtle will observe us as moving 400 percent faster than its own comfort zone, since its time flow runs at 15 hertz and ours runs at 60.

Similarly, the housefly will observe us as moving over 400 percent slower than its own comfort zone, since its flicker frequency is a blazing 250 hertz.

Insects only live a very short time, as far as we are concerned.

At least in some cases there is a direct relationship between lifespan and the speed of time perception.

The fly has lived a full lifespan, and had a variety of dynamic experiences, within the time unit of its very short existence.

### **NOW LET'S EXPAND THIS TO THE IDEA OF HUMAN BEINGS**

There is ample, redundant evidence from insider testimony, scientifically-validated sources like the Law of One material and alternative science that time itself can pass at different speeds.

Some of the truth is even commonly known in Einstein's relativity model, where traveling at near-light speed causes you to move through time much faster.

If you were inside that ship at near-light speed, you could potentially flip through 1000 years of our history in what you will perceive as one year.

The sources I just mentioned also reveal that some people have evolved to perceive time just like this.

The events that inspired the New Testament in the Bible, for example, could have all been fairly recent developments, when seen from an extraterrestrial perspective.

[As discussed by W.L. Graham on the Bible Reality Check website, the Bible is loaded with ET references, including the word "Lord" translating correctly as "the mighty ones."](http://biblerealitycheck.com/CosTheoReview.htm)

[2 Peter 3:8 is one Bible quote](http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Peter-3-8) that says "one day with (the mighty ones) is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."

Multiple Bible scholars believe the term "day" in this and other passages actually means "year," thus giving us a 1000-to-1 ratio.

Some of this data is cited in _The Ascension Mysteries,_ which had required my full attention up until I started a much-needed vacation two weeks ago.

### **LET'S CHANGE THE REFERENCE SCALE**

Let's say this Bible quote is not mere speculation or foolishness, but actually based on information obtained from positive extraterrestrial humans. 

Let's say you now perceive 1000 years as one year. Let's say it is now about to be the equivalent of June 2016 within your own frame of reference.

By this time scale, Earth humans would have only had motorized transportation, beginning with the locomotive, for the last two and a half months or so.

That would mean that prior to March 2016, everyone was traveling by horse and buggy.

Our own civilization would have only developed motorized transportation, communication at a distance and other 'modern' niceties since the Spring, and we're not even all the way into summer yet.

The apparent arrival and teachings of Jesus, as another example, would have only taken place in late May of 2014.

The great catastrophe that wiped out a worldwide civilization some call Atlantis would have scrubbed the surface of the earth clean in about the summer of 2003.

The Lemurian catastrophe of 50,000 years ago would have flattened out the largest civilization of giants who crash-landed on earth in about 1966.

### **ALL EVOLUTION WORKS THIS WAY**

Irrefutable scientific evidence will soon be presented in _The Ascension Mysteries_ revealing that earth-like planets, and human life, is very abundant.

This includes a Cambridge evolution expert openly proclaiming that intelligent life should look human wherever you go -- and explaining the reasons why.

Multiple cultures report experiences with human-looking "gods" who gave them all the niceties of our civilization, and then mysteriously disappeared from view. 

Like the Bible quote, the vast majority of insider sources confirm that ETs have a vastly different perception of time than we do.

They are able to project themselves into our world and interact with us at a speed we can handle, but apparently this is not sustainable for long periods.

This appears to be a natural aspect of the way intelligent life is designed in our universe as it continues evolving.

### **THE UNIVERSE PROVIDES GOOD LIVING SPACE FOR PEOPLE AS THEY ADVANCE**

As we have argued throughout our books and TV shows, and in _The Ascension Mysteries,_ the universe itself has a cosmic intelligence.

Part of the plan of that cosmic intelligence appears to be that there are vast habitable areas that naturally appear inside planets and moons.

These often involve large, honeycomb-like cave systems, sometimes 20 to 40 miles deep, with natural running water, bio-luminescent bacteria and complex life.

In these organic examples, natural internal heat makes them livable even if they are outside the "Goldilocks Zone" for habitable, watery worlds.

In other cases, intelligent civilizations locate underground areas like these and dramatically upgrade them, making them nearly similar to an Earth-like world inside.

Great efforts have been made to keep those of us on the "islands" from being aware of these places, for now, and of the people who already live in them.

### **TIME IS PERCEIVED MUCH DIFFERENTLY**

Ascension is ultimately a natural, highly predictable quantum leap in human evolution. In the aftermath, we live through vastly longer periods in one life than before.

As vetted-out sources like the Law of One series assert, there are four separate "quantum leaps" like this we will go through before reuniting with universal consciousness.

Each one of them causes us to experience much longer blocks of time as being "normal".

A million years could become like a year for someone in "sixth density," as another rough example of data that is hinted at in the Law of One series.

No one would want to live on the surface of a watery planet if they knew there was going to be an epic catastrophe every 26 years that would wipe them out.

Safe, happy and vibrant places inside the planet are much safer and better bets for civilizations with a naturally-accelerated time perception.

As we thoroughly explore in _The Ascension Mysteries,_ 35 different ancient cultures had the secrets of a 26,000-year cycle embedded in their myths.

The information about this cycle very redundantly includes the idea that the sun gives off a flash of light at the end, and the planet's surface suffers catastrophes.

### **SUPERPOWERS LOCKED UP IN OUR DNA ARE ACTIVATED**

I am not at all interested in doom and gloom or "fear porn." The information about this cycle, and the events that follow, is extremely widespread.

My goal is to reveal the data that we already have, and explore its remarkable implications for people in our own civilization, at our own time frequency.

It seems impossible to fathom that such a rapid change could occur, but if you saw it happen every 26 years, the truth would become very obvious to you.

This becomes your "normal" life. The idea of time passing as fast as it does for a fly, or even faster, and living for such a short time, is almost unthinkable.

In _The Ascension Mysteries,_ we argue that this is a deliberately-designed system by a universal intelligence.

These flashes of light and energy from the sun do appear to activate incredible "superpowers" that are currently locked up in our DNA.

### **IT IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC UPGRADE**

Not everyone gets these abilities when the event arrives.

Your wonderful superpowers only appear if you have developed enough, in the universal sense, that they are now authorized.

This means you are mature enough to use them without doing self-serving and evil things, like overpowering others to make them your slaves.

Great spiritual teachers like Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, Krishna and Moses all encouraged us to be more forgiving, compassionate and helpful to others.

These character traits do appear to be of critical importance in mastering the "class" we are all here to learn -- and graduating out of it via Ascension.

### **THE UNIVERSE HAS A COSMIC PLAN**

As offensive as it may seem to some people, the universe was designed with a very elaborate cosmic plan and purpose for each of us.

That purpose absolutely appears to be a spiritual one. The more we move away from trying to manipulate and control others, the farther along we are.

The "class" is winding up in our current cycle of 26 "Great Years." The bell is about to ring. Class dismissed.

It will soon be time for Graduation -- if you have earned your diploma. This is what all the great religious and spiritual teachings are trying to tell us.

The events in my own life have been unusual enough to convince me that this is definitely going to happen in our near future.

The first half of _The Ascension Mysteries_ is more personal than anything else I have ever written, and lays out exactly what happened to get me there.

By seeing the positive efforts that were made as well as how horribly I had to suffer before turning it all around, you can decide the truth for yourself.

### **A LAST-MINUTE EFFORT**

If someone like Jesus only appeared two years ago, in a higher frame of reference, then those teachings now become a last-minute effort to help us.

Only the most vitally important information for our own spiritual evolution would be included, since "cargo cults" can distort the core teachings dramatically.

Time runs so slowly for us that it seems that an event of this magnitude will never actually appear in our Now -- but it absolutely will.

Writing _The Ascension Mysteries,_ and summarizing so many different intersecting sources that all tell us the same thing, has been quite an awakening.

There was also a tremendous amount more to be said than I could possibly fit into one book, and that's why I am sharing all of this with you now.

### **FULL DISCLOSURE**

One of the most important things that will happen to prepare us for this event is a far more widespread disclosure of the truth.

We need an open, worldwide and sober discussion of the available evidence, and of the conclusions that it leads us towards.

Elijah Wood is only the most recent prominent celebrity to help change the hologram and alert us to what is really going on, and how dangerous it is.

Yet, if there are powerful people whose survival and profit depends upon our ignorance, they will do whatever they can to suppress the truth from us.

They are happy to allow "cargo cults" to flourish on the "islands" of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, and keep us shielded from everything and everyone else.

Everything I have shared with you up until now is intended to help familiarize you with what we now know from multiple insiders, including new arrivals.

In fact, certain groups fighting for humanity's future have been quite disappointed with me for not releasing more of this knowledge as it appears.

Hopefully this article will help to turn the tide. It doesn't matter if the viewership numbers aren't that high. It just needs to be out there before these events occur.

### **NEGATIVE ELITES ARE ALLOWED TO EXIST - AS A MIRROR**

"Third density" worlds like ours also have "elites" who manipulate and control us on vast scales.

This is ultimately allowed to occur by a loving universe. The elites hold up a planetary mirror that reflects our own inner childhood back to us.

Though we have not yet had a vast, public meltdown of the elite, the process is well underway. What you do with this available knowledge is your choice.

### **DISCHARGING KARMA AND COSMIC RESCUE PLANS**

Another thing these sequential catastrophes provides is a vehicle for discharging tremendous karma -- for those who need it.

If karma is real, and "elites" exist who have secretly been responsible for the torture, rape and murder of countless people, they need some way to balance it.

The vast majority of a population will not have invited or authorized these catastrophic events, and higher-level beings will ensure their complete safety.

Furthermore, sources like the Law of One tell us the Earth will activate a new "fourth-density" level that is apparently unaffected by such an event.

Some people will pop into this fourth-density earth, which will start out having all the same things we see here in the third -- a perfect mirror. 

Others will be rescued by various intelligent means, including being brought into vast Noah's Ark-type ships or relocated to areas inside the earth.

### **THE FOLLOW-UP ARTICLE IS COMING SOON**

Technically I am supposed to be on vacation right now, not working like this. I am enjoying two weeks off -- or not entirely off -- in the Canadian Rockies.

That includes taking the time to make ridiculous poses for my [Facebook,](https://www.facebook.com/DivineCosmosConvergence) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/david_wilcock/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/david_wilcock) pages.

This shot was taken at a particularly tempting-looking boulder on the shore of Emerald Lake.

![](/public/images/dw_canada_pose.jpg)

However, a very critical meeting between our insider Corey Goode and the SSP Alliance is about to take place just an hour or two after I post this.

From what I hear, they are unhappy that I haven't done more to push for Full Disclosure. I do apologize, as the book took a great deal of effort.

This is the first of a series of articles and other creative works I hope to release free of charge to help do my part to move things forward.

There could be developments that affect the rest of our story, and these first two parts have already become huge, so we will end it for now.

The insider operations are so sensitive and timely right now that the Alliance is very concerned about how much intel actually leaks.

As was the case in April, I hope to have the rest of this article emerge very soon, once we fully clarify what is safe to reveal at this time.
