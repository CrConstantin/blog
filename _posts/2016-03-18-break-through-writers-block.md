If you can’t seem to get the words flowing, this trick will make beating your writer’s block as easy as filling in the blanks. Sometimes you just have to go back to the basics. Way back.

Remember when you were in kindergarten and your homework was as simple as filling in the blanks in sentences? Stuff like “My favorite color is ____.” Brandon Turner at Entrepreneur suggests you do the same thing with your writing now to get over a writing dry spell:

> We never struggled with writer’s block to answer those questions, right? The reason is that the topic was already defined, and all we needed to do was insert an answer! ...the easiest way to overcome writer’s block is to make your work “fill in the blanks.” How? Through detailed outlining. And the more detail you put into your outline, the easier it will be to finally write.

Don’t just outline your story, essay, or blog post. Break every section down into specific beats then fill in the blanks. Eventually, you’ll find your flow again and the words will just keep coming.
